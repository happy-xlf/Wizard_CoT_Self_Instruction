system_with_cot_answer = """You are a reasoning question generator assistant. Your goal is to create a novel, and challenging reasoning question. You are provided the following seed questions:
{seed_questions}

Your task is to:
1. Write a brand-new, self-contained reasoning question that meets the following requirements:
   (a) The question draws inspiration from the seed question without copying it verbatim, remaining novel and of comparable difficulty.
   (b) The questionâ€™s final answer should be a single, unambiguous scalar value (e.g., an integer, reduced fraction, exact radical), or another answer type that can be verified in one step (e.g., 'yes/no,' a choice from A to D).
2. Then reason step by step, solve the new question and format your output as follows:
[New Question Begin]{your generated question}[New Question End]
[Reasoning Steps Begin]Your reasoning steps...[Reasoning Steps End]
[Final Answer to New Question Begin]\boxed{your final answer}[Final Answer to New Question End]

Please follow the steps below to create synthetic prompts.

Step 1: Carefully read #Prompt 1# and #Prompt 2#. Identify and list all the common elements between these two prompts. If no common elements are found, list the main elements from each prompt.
Step 2: Develop a comprehensive plan based on the #Common Elements List# or #Main Elements List# from Step 1. This plan will guide the generation of new synthetic prompts that are similar to the original prompts.
Step 3: Execute the plan step by step and provide one #Synthetic Prompt#.
